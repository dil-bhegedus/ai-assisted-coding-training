# Todo App with Atlas UI

![CI Status](https://github.com/dil-asomlai/ai-assisted-coding-training/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A React-based Todo application built with TypeScript, Material UI, and Atlas UI components. This project demonstrates modern React development practices with proper state management, component architecture, and comprehensive testing.

## Features

- ✅ Create, read, update, and delete todo items
- ✅ Mark todos as completed
- ✅ Session persistence - todos survive page refreshes
- ✅ Responsive design with Material UI
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ React Context for state management
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Prettier and ESLint for code quality
- ✅ Husky pre-commit hooks
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dil-asomlai/ai-assisted-coding-training.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd ai-assisted-coding-training

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build production-ready app
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to fix code issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Session Persistence

The Todo app automatically saves your todos to `sessionStorage`, ensuring your list persists through page refreshes within the same browser session. Key features include:

- **Automatic saving**: Todos are saved immediately when added, edited, or deleted
- **Graceful error handling**: Corrupted data is automatically cleared without crashing
- **Quota management**: Shows user-friendly notifications if storage quota is exceeded
- **Session scope**: Data persists only within the current browser session (cleared when browser is closed)

### Limitations
- Data is cleared when the browser session ends
- Storage quota errors may prevent saving in rare cases
- Only available in browsers that support `sessionStorage`
